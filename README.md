# statistical-analysis-with-R
The great things about computer programming is that there is an abundant amount of things to learn and tools to use. In the realm of data science one of those tools is **R**, which excels in statistical computation and graphics.

Having attended a data-analytics meetup, we got to explore a popular base R dataset known as [Iris](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/iris). In this quick analysis we practice data visualization and implement methods for statistical analysis, or regressions.
